I18n Data Repository for Rails 2.3
==================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/svenfuchs/rails-i18n.png)](http://travis-ci.org/svenfuchs/rails-i18n)

Central point to collect locale data for use in Ruby on Rails 2.3.

Note that you *cannot* install these data through RubyGems against Rails 2.3.
You should download data files into your `config/locales` directory.

If your Rails version is 4.0 or above, visit the [master](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n) branch.
If your Rails version is 3.x, visit the [rails-3-x](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/rails-3-x) branch.

## Installation

Download the locale files that are found in the directory [rails/locale](http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/rails-2-3/rails/locale/) and put them into the `config/locales` directory of your Rails application.

If any translation doesn't suit well to the requirements of your application, edit them or add your own locale files.
